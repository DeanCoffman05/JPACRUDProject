#Description 
This is firearm database. In the United States today, more illegal firearms are introduced through theft than any other means. Homes are broken into, cars are left unlocked and theives see this as an opportunity. One of the major issues in returning anything stolen is identification of the stolen items. Things like serial numbers and identifying marks can increase the odds of recovering the stolen item drasticlly. Writing down manufacturers, serial numbers, and all of the other details of a large firearm collect can seem daunting. This program aim to make it easier and more readily available on the web. This means it can be used on a smart phone or computer. The information can be easily turned over to authories or insurance companies when and if it's ever needed. This program gives the option to add, delete, modify and view all of the information in your personal database.

#Lessons Learned 
The over all structure of files, folders and how they work together was solidified for me. I have a much better understanding of how a DOA interacts with the controllers and the parts they play. I learned a lot about values and keywords and the rolls they play from the front all of the way to the back end of the program. After running into issues with integers and the converstions from Strings I have a much more solid foundation in parsing and other recognition of variable types as they  move through the porgram. I look forward to error messages now. I've learned a great deal about reading them and I've been able to see how valuable they really are in this career.
